Ivy has **three different APIs** to create commands. While this may seem 
overwhelming, you usually only will use one, and
it's a matter of personal preference which to use. This page explains the Command Builder API. The other three APIs are
explained on later pages.

The first way to create commands is using the **Command Builder API**. To create a command, call `Command.build()`.
Then, you can set the behavior of the command using the various methods on the builder.

```java
Command myFirstCommand = Command.build()
    .setStart(() -> {
        // executed on start
    })
    .setExecute(() -> {
        // executed on execute
    })
    .setDone(() -> {
        // return true to end the command
    })
    .setEnd(endCondition -> {
        // executed on end
    })
    .requires(/* requirements */)
    .setInterruptedBehavior(/* interrupted behavior */)
    .setBlockedBehavior(/* blocked behavior */)
    .setConflictBehavior(/* conflict behavior */)
    .setPriority(/* priority */);
```

All methods are optional, so you're free to not call a method you don't need.

For example, the arm command from the previous page could be written as follows:

```java
Command raiseArm = Command.build()
    .setExecute(() -> {
        armMotor.setPower(pidController.calculate(armMotor.getCurrentPosition()));
    })
    .setDone(() -> Math.abs(pidController.getTarget() - armMotor.getCurrentPosition()) < 10)
    .setEnd(endCondition -> armMotor.setPower(0))
    .requires(armMotor);
```
