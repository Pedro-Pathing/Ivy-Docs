Welcome to **Ivy by Pedro Pathing**, the simple, easy to use, and powerful
command-based control flow library for FTC.

## Install Ivy

In your `build.dependencies.gradle` file, add the following line in the
`dependencies` block:

```groovy [build.dependencies.gradle]
implementation 'com.pedropathing:ivy:1.0.0
```

Click the **Sync Now** button that appears in your IDE.

## Create an OpMode

Create a new OpMode in your FTC project. Add the highlighted lines to your 
OpMode:

```java [MyOpMode.java] {5, 10}
@Autonomous(name = "My OpMode")
public class MyOpMode extends OpMode {
    @Override
    public void init() {
        Scheduler.reset();
    }
    
    @Override
    public void loop() {
        Scheduler.execute();
    }
}
```
